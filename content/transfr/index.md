During this time I was a Developer through Triangle Factory doing B2B for Transfr, a company creating and shipping VR Trainings.
My day to day work included taking the Training, analyzing the needed work, making time estimates for how long tasks would take, communicating with the training creator about issues or tweaks they came accross, communicating with the lead engineers for bugs in the framework and possible solutions, going back to older products and bringing them up to par with the new quality standard. 

Some examples of the shipped modules I worked on:

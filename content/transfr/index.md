### The project:
Through Triangle Factory I worked as a developer in a B2B sceneario, where we developed VR Trainings.

**Created with** Unity3D

**Developed for** Meta Quest 2

### The team:

It was generally 1 developer per training, supervised by a PM to oversee communication towards Transfr designers. 

### My role:
My day to day work included taking the Training, analyzing the needed work, making time estimates for how long tasks would take, communicating with the designer about issues or tweaks they came accross, communicating with the lead engineers for bugs in the framework and possible solutions, going back to older products and bringing them up to par with the new quality standard. 

Some examples of the shipped modules I worked on:

* [Diesel training](https://transfrinc.com/products/diesel/)
* [Aviation](https://transfrinc.com/products/aviation/)
* [transfr site](https://transfrinc.com/)

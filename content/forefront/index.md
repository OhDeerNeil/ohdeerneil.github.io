### The project:

[Forefront](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQhvyFRlYcs) is a chaotic 32 player shooter, trying to bring those battlefield moments into VR.
Making players work together in squads to take the objectives, and making sure they use all available gadgets and vehicles to give their team an edge.


**Created with** Unity3D, Blender, Photon Fusion 2

**Developed for** Meta Quest 2/Meta Quest 3, Pico, and Steam VR

### The team:
Created by TriangleFactory, at peak the team was around 35 people.

### My role:
As a programmer, my role existed out of the expected support of main features, to helping out with performance wherever possible, to implementing systems that needed to fit the full picture, with the following being some of the main features I was responsible for:
**Features**
 - nametag system
 - explosive charge
 - UI rotation systems
 - LineOfSightObstruction system
 - spotting system
 - voice chat
 - UI Priority system
 - score system
 - TRC's for the Quest release
 - Vehicle UI
 - Killer highlights 
 - improved hit indicators


Some of the notable support I worked on:

**Bugfixes**
 - hand pose tool
 - ordered spawning
 - memory leaks
 - animation issues
 - zipline camera stutter issue
 - spawn menu generator extension
 - cleanup of the spawn menu UI
 - nametag stutter


**Performance**:
 - jobifying
 - GBAlloc in different system
 - UI optimizations: overdraw, sprite renderers vs canvas
